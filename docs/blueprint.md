## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calm, stable, trustworthy blue (#75A9FF).
- Background color: Very light blue to complement the primary (#F0F5FF).
- Accent color: A contrasting, exciting, and positive orange (#FF9F4A) will make the CTAs pop and create energy.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a modern, tech-forward feel in headlines and short display text; Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for comfortable reading in longer text.
- Use clean, simple, and consistent icons related to payments and transaction status.
- A clean and intuitive layout with clear sections for login, dashboard, payment input, and transaction history. Use of whitespace to avoid clutter.
- Subtle animations and transitions for user feedback (e.g., loading states, successful transaction confirmations).
